# CitizenEnforcer
A basic Discord .NET moderation & edit/delete log bot. Logs moderation actions to a SQLite database.

If you want to use this bot yourself, you'll need to download the source and run a EF migration to generate the database.

The config file sits in config/configuration.json and includes a list of owner IDs, and bot prefix/token.
